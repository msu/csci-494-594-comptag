# CSCI 494/594: CompTaG Seminar #

Course Description: 

A one-credit seminar designed to support students with an interest or curiosity
for research in computational topology and geoemetry.

## Course Outcomes and Objectives

This seminar course introduces students to research in computational topology
and geometry.  After taking this course, students will be able to:

* Read and discuss recent research in the field.
* Present (both orally and written) topics in computational topology and
  geometry to peers.

## When and Where?

When? Please seee slack for details.

Where? CompTaG lab (Barnard 346) or Zoom (please see email for link) 

## How do I contact you?

The preferred method to ask questions relating to this class is via Slack message.
Students are also encouraged to visit me during my [office hours](https://www.cs.montana.edu/office-hours.html).

## What is in this repository?

This repo contians the syllabus for this class.

## Grading

Your grade for this class will be determined by:

- Participation in the seminar (almost every week)
- Completing the onboarding tasks
- Presenting in the seminar (at least once)
- Notes and reflections from seminar meetings (recorded in your CompTaG journal)
- Feedback to peers on presentations (recorded in your CompTaG journal)
- Working on the open problems or background research beyond the confides of the seminar
- Final reflection, due by the end of finals week.

This seminar course is one (1) credit, which is about 50 hours of work throughout the
semester. Please log your hours through the repo that we set-up in
github.org/comptag-members.   At the end of the semester, students will prepare
a document summarizing their participation in the CompTaG seminar.


## Format

Each semester, the format of the seminar changes, depending on who is attending
and current research going on in the group.  Some seminar formats include:

* SoCG papers: In Spring semesters, we often select three-ish papers accepted to
  [SoCG](https://www.cs.montana.edu/office-hours.htmls) and take three weeks to
  discuss each paper.  Roughly, the three weeks are broken down as follows: Week
  1 typically goes over background material (that may or may not be in the
  background of the paper. Week 2 discusses the results of the paper itself.
  Week 3 discusses where the research can go from here.
* Open problems:  When we want to dive into assorted open problems for a
  semester, we typically spend a couple weeks selecting four open problems.
  Then, each open problem will have three weeks dedicated to it.  Week 1 will go
  overthe problem and what is already known.  Week 2 will be working on the
  problem in small groups.  Week 3 will depend on the problem and the progress
  made.
* CompTaG research: Some semesters, we focus on diving deeper into the research
  going on within the CompTaG research group. In these semesters, some
  presentations are focused on the basics of CompTag, which gives seasoned
  CompTaG members a chance to practice explaining the basics and new members a
  chance to catch up on the background.  Other weeks dive into the actual
  research problems students are working on, with a focus on discussing any
  sticking points and highlighting where there's room for more people to join a
  project.

In addition, ech semester, we may have some weeks where the presentation are
practice presentations for conferences, lectures by visiting scholars, or
roundtables to discuss sticking points for current research.
