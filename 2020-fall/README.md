## Grading

Your grade for this class will be determined by:

- Participation in the seminar (almost every week)
- Presenting in the seminar / leading a breakout room (at least once throughout
  the semester)
- Notes and reflections from seminar meetings
- Feedback to peers on presentations
- Working on the open problems beyond the confides of the seminar

This seminar course is 1 credit, which is about 50 hours of work throughout the
semester. Please log your hours through the repo that we set-up in
github.org/comptag-members 

This semester, we will discuss four different open problems.  Each open problem
will take three weeks.  Week 1 will be a small group describing the problem and
what is known.  Week 2 will be working on the problem in zoom breakout rooms.
Week 3 will depend on the problem.
